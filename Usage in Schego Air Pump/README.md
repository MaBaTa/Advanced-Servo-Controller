# ASC as Inverter for (Schego) Air Pump

This is a subproject of the usage of the ASC as a inverter for a membrane compressor.

### Prestory:

Since I have been looking for a small compressor that is quiet and high 
quality for a long time, I was very happy when I came across the company
 Schego. They produce a small range of aquarium / industrial membrane 
pumps. Since I also intend to use them in the area of air-brush & 3D
 printers, I was very happy to have finally found a quieter and more 
robust version that also is Made in Germany, after all the China compressors. The only
 catch is of course the price, whereas the 230V variants are perfectly 
appropriate priced. But since I need 12V for most applications, these were not 
really an option for me. So I came up with the idea of simply buying a 
230V version, and operating it with the help of the ASC. For this to 
work, however, the electromagnet must also be adapted, more on this 
later.

### The Schego M2K3:

I've bougt a M2K3 since it is the biggest Model and i got it used a bit less expensive. The cool thing about this (and probaply all Schego models), is that you can easily disassemble it.
